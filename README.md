# Chhotabanner

This should theoretically work from iOS 13 - 16. But 13 and 15 are untested for the time being.
## Instructions for iOS 16 (Serotonin)
first install roothide patcher and open the .deb file in it and patch it with the 1st option (Directly convert simple tweaks) and then install the patched .deb with sileo.
